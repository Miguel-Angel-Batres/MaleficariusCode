          Hello, I am Miguel Angel Batres Luna. I am 20 years old and I am a
          student of Computer Systems Engineering at the Autonomous University
          of Aguascalientes, Mexico. I enjoy programming and editing things. I
          am a fan of video games and most branches of programming. Nowadays, I
          work with various programming languages, especially C, C++, Java,
          JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This little ghost you can see here is called "LostSoul." I took its
          image from the PNGWING Official Website, and it represents me on this
          website. As you can see, LostSoul is flying around this website,
          searching for something, but it doesn't seem to know what it is
          looking for. It will be with you while you're here, so be nice to it.

          I work on various projects, specializing in video games, websites,
          competitive programming, and databases. I also work with different
          operating systems, with Linux being my main programming environment.

          Since I was 17 years old, I have been studying programming, and one
          day I would like to become a great developer and programmer. Although
          I don't have a specific language or focus in this field, I am very
          interested in reading and learning more about various topics in new
          technology and how it helps us on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am focused on competitive programming and game
          development. Although the latter is more personal and less commercial,
          it remains a vast world for programming development.
