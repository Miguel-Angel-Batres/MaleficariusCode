              Playing music is one of my favorite hobbies. I've been playing drums for 1 year now, and I can say that it's the most relaxing thing I've ever done in my life.
              </p>
              <p>
              Although my main instrument right now is drums, I've also been playing guitar for 7 years and playing bass for 2 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that music is a way of life that also helps you in the professional part, playing instruments is like programming, you need to practice day after day to reach a good level, and above all, once you know what you're doing, there is no limit.

              The world of video games is something that I have been passionate about since I was a child. I am a big fan of many genres, such as indie, shooters, mmorpg, moba, etc.
            </p><p>
              I have always been interested in the development of video games, and I have always wanted to create my own games. Certainly creating them is very different from playing them, since commercially games depend on the acceptance of others, and it is difficult to achieve something like that, however you can always count on self-confidence.
