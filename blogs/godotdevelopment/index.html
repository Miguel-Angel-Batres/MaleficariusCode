        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Origins (2007): </b>Godot was created by Juan Linietsky, an
            Argentinian software developer, in 2007. Initially, it was developed
            as a proprietary engine for a client project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open Sourcing (2007 - 2008): </b>In 2007, Linietsky decided to
            release the engine as an open-source project under the MIT license.
            This marked the beginning of Godot as a community-driven project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Version 1.0 (April 2014): </b>The first stable release, Godot

        <h2><b>Hollow Knight (Silk Song)</b></h2>
        <p>
          Hollow Knight: Silk Song is an upcoming sequel to the critically
          acclaimed game Hollow Knight, which was the first game made with unity
          engine, but this time Team Cherry decided to use godot engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game features a new protagonist, Hornet, as she explores new
          areas, battles enemies, and unravels the mysteries of the kingdom of
          Hallownest. With its beautiful art style, challenging gameplay, and
          atmospheric world, Hollow Knight: Silk Song is highly anticipated by
          fans of the original game.

        <p>
          Personally, I really like this game; it has a large number of
          scenarios, final bosses, enemies, and all sorts of interesting things
          to comment on. It's definitely a good game, and with this, I want to
          convey the idea that any graphic engine can be useful, but here the
          problem lies in the question: ¿Which one is worth it to use?

        <h2><b>Sonic Colors</b></h2>
        <p>
          One of the most popular games made with Godot is Sonic Colors, a
          fan-made game that was developed by a team of dedicated fans. The game
          is a 2D platformer that features Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends as
          they embark on a new adventure to save the world from the evil Dr.
          Eggman. The game has received positive reviews from players and
          critics alike, and it showcases the capabilities of the Godot Engine
          for creating high-quality games.

        <p>
          Believe it or not this is a game made with godot, and it looks
          amazing, but this is not everything, the company that made this game
          took godot and made a lot of changes to the engine to make it look
          like this, and this is the power of godot, you can take the engine and
          make it look like you want, that's why developers who love Open Source
          and Free Software love godot.

        <h2><b>Brotato</b></h2>

        <p>
          Brotato is a 2D platformer game that was developed by a team of indie
          developers using the Godot Engine. The game features a potato
          protagonist who embarks on a journey to save his friends from an evil
          villain. The game showcases the capabilities of Godot for creating 2D
          platformer games with engaging gameplay and charming visuals.

        />
        <br />
        <p>
          Brotato is an example that for a game to be good, it doesn't
          necessarily require the most excellent graphics and/or details to be
          fun and exciting. Brotato is a game where you go straight to the point
          – killing enemies non-stop. Personally, I love this game because I've
          always been a fan of games where you eliminate a large number of
          enemies. Besides the simplicity of Brotato, it just offers a unique
          experience to the player.

          In each level, there will be money to collect as well as some vitality

          others.

        <p>
          Beast Invaders is a spaceship game very similar to the famous game
          Space Invaders, but this game has the power to squeeze every drop out
          of the Godot game engine, proving not only that Godot is a powerful
          game engine if used correctly but also that it can compete with
          powerful game engines like Unreal Engine. Being open source,
          everything is possible with Godot Engine, and that's what makes it a
          great tool for game development.

        <h1 class="centrado">¿Why Not Unreal Engine and Unity?</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Unreal Engine and Unity are two of the most popular game engines in
          the world, and they are widely used by professional game developers
          and studios. However, there are several reasons why you might choose
          Godot over these engines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Cost:</b> Godot is free to use, and there are no royalties or
            licensing fees for commercial projects. This makes it an attractive
            option for indie developers and small studios with limited budgets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open Source:</b> Godot is an open-source project, which means
            that its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify,
            and distribute. This allows developers to customize the engine to
            suit their needs and contribute to its ongoing development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lightweight:</b> Godot is a lightweight engine that is designed
            to run on a wide range of hardware, including low-end devices. This
            makes it an ideal choice for developing games for mobile platforms
            and other resource-constrained environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Flexibility:</b> Godot is highly extensible, allowing developers
            to create custom modules, plugins, and tools to enhance its
            capabilities. This gives developers more control over their projects
            and allows them to experiment with new ideas and technologies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While Unreal Engine and Unity are powerful and feature-rich engines,
          Godot offers a compelling alternative for developers who value
          cost-effectiveness, open-source software, and flexibility. Its growing
          popularity and active community make it an attractive choice for indie
          developers and hobbyists who want to create high-quality games without
          breaking the bank.
