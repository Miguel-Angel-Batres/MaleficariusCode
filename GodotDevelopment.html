        <p>
          <ul><li>
            <b>Origins (2007): </b>Godot was created by Juan Linietsky,
             an Argentinian software developer, in 2007. Initially, 
             it was developed as a proprietary engine for a client project.
          </li><li>
            <b>Open Sourcing (2007 - 2008): </b>In 2007, Linietsky decided 
            to release the engine as an open-source project under the MIT license.
             This marked the beginning of Godot as a community-driven project.
            </li><li>
            <b> Version 1.0 (April 2014): </b>The first stable release, 
            Godot 1.0, was launched in April 2014. It provided a range of features
